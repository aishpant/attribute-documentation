attribute documentation
-----------------------

`abi2doc` is a helper tool for generating and formatting sysfs attribute
documentation which is location under ``Documentation/ABI``\  in the
kernel source code.

From a `rough estimate`_, there are around 2000 attributes that are
undocumented in the kernel.

The ABI documentation format looks like the following:

| What: (the full sysfs path of the attribute)
| Date: (date of creation)
| KernelVersion: (kernel version it first showed up in)
| Contact: (primary contact)
| Description: (long description on usage)

`abi2doc` can fill in the '`Date`' and the '`KernelVersion`' fields with
high accuracy. The '`Contact`' details is prompted for once, and the
others '`What`' and '`Description`' are prompted on every attribute.

It also tries to collect description from various sources-

-  From the commit message that introduced the attribute

-  From comments around the attribute show/store functions or the attribute declaring macro.

-  From the structure fields that map to the attribute.
   
   For eg. consider the attribute declaring macro `PORT_RO(dest_id)` and its show function `port_destid_show(...)`.

  .. code:: c

            static ssize_t
            port_destid_show(struct device *dev, struct device_attribute *attr,
                             char *buf)
            {
                    struct rio_mport *mport = to_rio_mport(dev);

                    if (mport)
                            return sprintf(buf, "0x%04x\n", mport->host_deviceid);
                    else
                            return -ENODEV;
            }



  The show functions typically contain a conversion to a driver private struct and then one or many fields from it are put in the buffer. 

  In the example above, the driver private structure is a struct of type `rio_mport` and the attribute `port_id` maps to the field `host_deviceid` in the structure.

  .. code:: c

      struct rio_mport {
            ...
            int host_deviceid;      /* Host device ID */
            struct rio_ops *ops;    /* low-level architecture-dependent routines */
            unsigned char id;       /* port ID, unique among all ports */
            ...
            };

  There's a comment against `host_deviceid` here and this can be extracted.

All sysfs attribute declaring macros are located in ``abi2doc/macros.txt``. Each
row of `macros.txt` contains an attribute declaring macro space
separated by the location of the attribute name in the macro -
`DEVICE_ATTR 0`. This list is not complete. Please send a pull request if
you find any that are not in the list.

Usage
-----

Prerequisites:

-  Coccinelle - `install instructions`_
-  Python 3
-  Linux Kernel source code

`abi2doc` is available on `PYPI`_. Install with ``pip``:

  ``pip install abi2doc``

The library is currently tested against Python versions `3.4+`.

.. code:: bash

    usage: abi2doc [-h] -f SOURCE_FILE -o OUTPUT_FILE

    Helper for documenting Linux Kernel sysfs attributes

    required arguments:
      -f SOURCE_FILE  linux source file to document
      -o OUTPUT_FILE  location of the generated sysfs ABI documentation

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help      show this help message and exit

Example usage:

.. code:: bash

    abi2doc -f drivers/video/backlight/lp855x_bl.c -o sysfs_doc.txt

The script will fill in the '`Date`' and the '`KernelVersion`' fields for
found attributes. The '`Contact`' details is prompted for once, and the
others 'What' and '`Description`' are prompted on every attribute. The
entered description will be followed by hints, as shown in a generated
file below.

                backlight: add new lm3639 backlight driver

                This driver is a general version for LM3639 backlgiht + flash driver chip
                of TI.

                LM3639:
                The LM3639 is a single chip LCD Display Backlight driver + white LED
                Camera driver.  Programming is done over an I2C compatible interface.

Expected time for the scripts to run =

  `(num of attrs x avg 4 min per attr)/num of cores`.

Contributions
-------------

Thank you for reading up till here. Contributions are welcome, whether
it is in the form of code or documentation. This projects consists of
scripts written in Python 3 and `Coccinelle`_.


Some top of the mind tasks are:

-  [ ] spatch runs assuming 4 cores. This should be corrected to match
   the developer's machine
-  [ ] support for verbose & quiet mode. Some print statements are for
   debugging purpose and they should be printed in verbose mode only.
-  [x] utilise all cores. The ``git log -L`` command in doc.py takes a
   *very* long time to run. The script would be much faster if it runs
   in parallel.
-  [ ] code cleanup. Some for-loops can be replaced by list
   comprehensions etc. `flake8` can be useful for finding such issues.
